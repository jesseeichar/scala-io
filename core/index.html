              <div><h3>Summary:</h3><span>
        <p>The main goals of Scala IO is to provide a scalable solution to IO for Scala.  In more
        concrete terms, the desire is to be able to both easily and quickly access the data from a
        data source like a file or URL as well as provide the options to micro manage how the data is
        accessed when performance is of the utmost importance.</p>
        <p>The first aspect is to provide an ARM (Automatic Resource Management) solution so resources
        are automatically closed after use.  The design for ARM is essentially the loaner pattern where
        the framework opens a resource and passes the resource to a codeblock/function allowing the
        function to only concern itself with the data access logic and the ARM implementation will guarantee
        that the resource is closed after the access, irregardless of whether an error occurred or not.</p>
        <p>The second aspect is to provide lazy collection style access to an underlying resource allowing
        the skills obtained using the Scala collections library to be used to quickly implement solutions
        as if the resource is simply a collection.  The underlying implementation will ensure the resource
        is closed and will ensure that only the necessary data is loaded.  For example calls to drop will
        skip bytes when possible and take will close the connection after the requested data is obtained</p>
        <p>The third aspect is, as of 0.1 not yet implemented, is asynchronous data access in a simple manner.
        The first solution that is provided has been popularized by node js and is essentially the ability
        to register callbacks with a resource and they can, when possible, be executed in a single thread with
        a single connection.</p>
        <p>The fourth aspect (also not implemented for 0.1) is an iteree pattern for IO.  This design will
        will be the basis of the async aspect and will have two levels of complexity.  The first will be
        a simple function callback to obtain all data and the second will be the ability to return a Done
        event to short-circuit the data loading.</p>
        <p>The final piece of the puzzle is the provide a consistent manner for handling exceptions.  The
        initial implementation simply throws exceptions as they occur but it will be possible to register an
        exception handle with your ARM resource to control how to handle exceptions.

                                  <div class="example_excerpt_summary"><span> Writing Arrays is a special situation because of how Java and Scala use arrays.  For performance Scala uses the Java Array object and coerces them into Traversable objects when the Scala collections methods are needed.  However the implicit resolution will not choose a TraversableConverter.  Fortunately Scala IO provides several Converters for converting Arrays to bytes.  <p> The point of this example is explain that if one is creating a custom converter he will have to consider creating both a OutputConverter[Traversable[_]] as well as a OutputConverter[Array[_]]</p></span></div>

Because of this write,patch,insert,etc...  are overloaded with a typeclass version as well as a version that takes a string.  <p> The result is that writing strings is a simple exercise but writing characters or Traversables of characters is less trivial.
