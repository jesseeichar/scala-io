/**
 * The Common API for declaring a process workflow on an Input object.  This class contains all the operations
 * that can performed.  A ProcessorAPI object essentially wraps a data source/resource that provides
 * elements of type A, the methods allow the developer to read and skip over the elements as needed.
 *
 * '''Also see the section below about data specific APIs'''
 *
 * The processing package contains classes for processing and the ProcessorAPI is the core of
 * the Processing API.
 *
 * The concept behind the processing API is to declare the format in a largely declarative manner and read the contents
 * as needed.  The processing API is largely not needed when only a single input object is to be processed however
 * it could be considered to be slightly easier to read but when multiple input objects are to be processed at the same
 * time and have interdependencies then the processing API becomes indispensable.
 *
 * There are two commonly used patterns: extract a single item of data from Input objects and extract a collection of
 * data elements from Input objects.
 *
 * Pattern 1: Read a single item of data from Input objects:
 *
 * {{{
 * val headerProcessor = for {
 *   api1 <- input.bytes.processor
 *   api2 <- input2.bytes.processor
 *   header1 <- api.take(100)
 *   header2 <- api2.take(100)
 * } yield new Header(header1,header2)
 *
 * headerProcessor.acquireAndGet(header => /* do something with header */)
 * }}}
 *
 * In this use case the format is declared as the for-comprehension and the result is returned by the yield.
 * The val headerProcessor is not executed executed until acquireAndGet is executed, at that point it essentially
 * is the process workflow for reading the headers.  The acquireAndGet method executes the process and passes the resulting
 * object to the function argument.
 *
 * @note There is no method for directly obtaining the result of the
 * process because of the next use-case.  As you will see the ProcessorAPI has repeat*** methods that result in
 * Processor[Iterator[A] ], in this case the iterator only works when the resources are open.  Because of this all processors
 * must be accessed within a context where they will be correctly closed after accessing.
 *
 * In short, accessing the result of a Processor is done within the acquireAndGet method (or via traversable, see next section).
 *
 * Pattern 2: Define a repetitive format and obtain a LongTraversable[A] for processing each element defined by the format:
 *
 * {{{
 * val process = for {
 *   api1 <- input.bytes.processor
 *   api2 <- input.chars.processor
 *   _ <- api1.repeatUntilEmpty()
 *   binaryData <- api1.take(100)
 *   attributes <- api2.takeWhile(_ != '\n')
 *  } yield new Record(binaryData,attributes)
 *
 * process.traversable // do something with traversable of records
 * }}}
 *
 * In this example the entire api1 is processed until it is empty.  The value ''process'' is of type Process[Iterator[Record] ]
 * and can be accessed by using either acquireAndGet or traversable.  acquireAndGet behaves the same way as for Pattern 1
 * and the iterator is accessed as normal.  However the iterator must not escape the acquireAndGet because it will
 * no longer be valid because the resources it depends on will be closed, thus the traversable is often a better option because
 * it returns a LongTraversable and can be used repeatedly without concern about the underlying resources being left open or
 * closed while the traversable continues to be used.
 *
 * @note when using repeatUntilEmpty() the following lines must consume data from the ProcessorAPI otherwise the loop will
 * never terminate (because it will never be empty)
 *
 * @note repeatUntilEmpty takes parameters so that it will repeat until a set of ProcessorAPI objects are empty rather just one
 *
 * Notice the difference between:
 *
 * {{{
 * for {
 *   api1 <- input.bytes.processor
 *   api2 <- input.chars.processor
 *   _ <- api1.repeatUntilEmpty()
 *   _ <- api2.repeatUntilEmpty()
 *   ...
 * } ...
 * }}}
 *
 * and
 *
 * {{{
 * for {
 *   api1 <- input.bytes.processor
 *   api2 <- input.chars.processor
 *   _ <- api1.repeatUntilEmpty(api2)
 *   ...
 * } ....
 * }}}
 *
 * and
 *
 * {{{
 * for {
 *   api1 <- input.bytes.processor
 *   _ <- api1.repeatUntilEmpty()
 *   api2 <- input.chars.processor
 *   _ <- api2.repeatUntilEmpty()
 *   ...
 * } ....
 * }}}
 *
 * In case 1 the process follow api2.repeatUntilEmpty will be repeated until api2 is empty and if api1 is not empty the
 * process will never end.  This is because api1 will repeatUntilEmpty but api2 is empty so it will simply return
 *
 * In case 2 the process will repeat until both api1 and api2 are empty
 *
 * In case 3 api2 will be created then the process will repeat until api2 is empty.  Then api1 will be checked to see if
 * it is empty.  If it is then the api2 will be created again and the process will be repeated until api2 is again empty. etc...
 *
 * All the normal behaviour of for-comprehensions are supported as well, including guards, pattern matching etc...
 *
 * In addition to this class, one can wrap this API with a type Specific API for a particular type a.  For example
 * support A is bytes, ByteProcessorAPI can be used to gain access to APIs that are specific to working with Bytes.

   * Read the next element in the input source if possible.

   * If there is an element left in the input source a Processor containing that element will be returned, otherwise

   *
   * Since next will return an empty processor it will terminate the looping in a for-comprehension and the resulting Processor
   * could be an empty processor.  This can be a problem when reading from multiple input sources.  the opt method can be used to
   * modify the returned processor so that it returns a Processor[Option[_]] that is never empty.  COnsider the following examples
   *
   * Example:
   * {{{
   * for {
   *   api1 <- input1.bytes.processor
   *   api2 <- input2.bytes.processor
   *   _ <- api1.repeatUntilEmpty()
   *   api1Next <- api.next

   *   api1Next <- api.next
   *   nextOpt <- api2.next.opt
   * } println(api1Next)

   * The two examples appear similar.  The first example will print the bytes from input1 until input2 is empty.  Where
   * as in example 2 will print all of api1 irregardless of whether api2 is empty or not.
   *
   * The reason is that in example 1 (next), next returns an empty processor when input2 is empty and thus the println
   * is not executed.  In example 2 the Processor is never empty it is either Some or None.
   *
   * @note if the process has a repeatUntilEmpty() method call, next.opt should be preferred over next.
   *       See repeatUntilEmpty for a more detailed description of why
   *
   * @return An empty processor if there are no more elements in the input source or a processor containing the next element
