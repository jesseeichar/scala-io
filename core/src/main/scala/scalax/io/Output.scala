 *
 * Note: Each invocation of a method will typically open a new stream or
 * channel. That behaviour can be overridden by the implementation but
 * it is the default behaviour.
 *
 * The consequence of a new stream being opened each time a write is performed
 * is different for each implementation.  In the case of a [[scalax.io.Resource]].fromFile
 * reach write will write to the beginning of the file rather than appending to the file.
