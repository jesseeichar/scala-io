/**
 * A strategy object representing an action to take upon closingÂ a [[scalax.io.Resource]].
 * CloseActions can be composed using the +: and :+ method and can be added to a [[scalax.io.Resource]]
 * when it is created or added to an existing [[scalax.io.Resource]] object.
 *
 * If an exception is raised by the CloseAction it will be cause by the apply method and will be
 * returned to the Resource calling the exception.   Normally the exception will be added to the collection
 * of Throwables in the Resource so errors triggered by the CloseActions will be obtainable from the Resource.
 *
 * Also related to exceptions is the fact that all CloseActions will be executed when they are combined.
 * For example if CloseAction A and B are combined and A fails with an exception B will still be executed.
 *
 * The easiest method for creating a close action is to simply call
 * the [[scalax.io.CloseAction]].apply factory method.  It takes a function and contructs
 * a CloseAction from it.
