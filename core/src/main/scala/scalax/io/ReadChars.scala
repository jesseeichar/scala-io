 * An trait for objects that viewed as a sequence of characters. For example java.io.Reader

 * Note: All collections returned are non-strict collections and each
 * invocation of a method will typically open a new stream or channel.
 * That behaviour can be overrided by the implementation but
 * it is the default behaviour.
 *
 * The Default implementation is based on providing an implementation for
 * chars method and all other methods are implemented using
