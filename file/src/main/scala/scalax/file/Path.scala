  /**
   * Attempts to obtain a secured PathSet.  This method and the associated secureTree are intended
   * to be used for security sensitive operations that need to access and/or traverse directory structures
   * in a race free manner.
   * <p>
   * Not all filesystems can support this,  if not then None will be returned.  Using this method will ensure that
   * during the duration of an operation on the {@link PathSet} no external processes
   * are able to modify the directory.
   * </p><p>
   * The stream can also be used as a "virtual" working directory
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * No exceptions will be thrown by this method if it is called and the Path is a File or does not exist.  Instead the {@link PathSet}
   * will throw a NotDirectoryException when a method is called and the underlying object is not a Directory.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * <strong>Note:</strong> calling this method does not lock the directory.  Only performing operations on the SecureDirectoryStream will lock the directory.
   * <p>
   * </p>
   * For Example:
   * </p>
   * <pre><code>
   * val tree = path.walkTree()
   * // directory is not yet locked
   * tree.foreach {
   *   // now the directory is locked
   *   println _
   * }
   * // directory has been unlocked
   * </code>
   * <p>
   * @param filter
   *          A filter that restricts what paths are available in the PathSet.
   *          The directoryStream methods explains why this is often the efficient method
   *          for filtering directories
   *          Default is None
   * @return
   *          A managed resource managing a PathSet.
